      <b>a collection of English poems, Sabhya Prakashana: New Delhi, 2017</b><br/><br/>
      <b>About the book:</b><br/>
      The poems in this volume by Seema Jain depict her sincere observations through her
      simple narratives and ideal metaphors. She is engaging herself with the world around her. Her
      poems reflect the quality of the culture we are living in.<br/><br/>
      The poem ‘A Dark December Day’ reminds us of the Nirbhaya case in Delhi which left
      every individual in the country shocked. Such cases are still happening. Seema Jain thus
      questions the unnecessary favours we give to our sons and the subtle prejudices that we show
      towards our daughters. This is because the value system in our country is crumbling.<br/><br/>
      The poems in this volume further highlight the complexities that exist in our society and
      the poet feels that the subjective observations are impacting the message and relevance of our
      age-old values. The poet is disappointed with the instances of male chauvinism. She uses the
      images from the foliage to make her poetry more comprehensible. She uses these images to
      reflect social dichotomies and divisions that exist today.<br/><br/>

      <b>a collection of English poems, Authors Press: New Delhi, 2020</b><br/><br/>
      This collection of English poems titled <b>Silent Letters</b> is her fourth anthology of poems (second in
      English), the previous ones being <b>An Apology to My Father</b>, <b>Mom Ke Pankh</b>, and <b>Dhoop
      Chhanv</b>.<br/><br/>
      The present book contains Forty Nine poems, divided into four sections titled <b>Social Prism</b>,
      <b>Heard and Unheard Melodies</b>, <b>Canvas of Life</b>, and <b>Corona Times</b>. Written in a simple, lucid, and
      appealing style with a unique grace and charm, the poems in this collection focus on diverse
      themes such as marginalisation of some sections of society (referred to as silent letters in the title
      poem) besides gender issues, political machinations, etc. Some of the poems are about
      relationships in their varied forms, moods, and hues, paradoxes and intricacies of life, besides
      dealing with experiences of the recent Corona pandemic.<br/><br/>
      This is what Dr Maja Herman Sekulic, the Serbian-American Novelist, Essayist, Translator
      &amp; Goodwill Ambassador, has to say about the poet and her writing:<br/><br/>
      <i>Seema Jain is a rarely gifted poet of very delicate soulful verses that show us the most hidden
      scars and deepest emotions through silent cries of hurt but also through her poetic and humane
      yearning for goodness and beauty and above all else freedom to fly out of our invisible cages.
      She shields herself from the hostile world by symbolically putting on every morning her make-
      up and a smile and yet she wants to break out and freely fly like a bird or a butterfly. I highly
      recommend her latest collection as a good sophisticated read.</i><br/><br/>

      <b>An Anthology of 21st Century Indian Women Poets (Sahitya Akademi publication 2022)</b><br/><br/>
      The genre of Indian English has been abundantly rich, and within its domain, Indian women
      poets writing in English have a well-established tradition. The impressive legacy of Toru Dutt,
      Sarojini Naidu, Kamla Das and so many other women poets continues its successive journey
      with several outstanding and vibrant poetic voices in the 21st century.<br/><br/>
      The present collection of 102 women poets, currently engaged in penning their sensibility, is an
      endeavour to map this genre as it is evolving today and to present its varied shades and nuances.
      It incorporates leading and celebrated poets as well as new and emerging ones, from various
      corners of India to some of the Indian Diasporas and brings a spectrum of multiple and disparate
      experiences and artistic expressions.<br/><br/>

      <b>The Vanquished Queen: The Diary of Kaikeyi (Hindi to English)</b><br/><br/>
      The 14-year-exile is long over. Treaties and ties have been established and sealed with promises,
      rewards, and tributes. The royal treasury overflows with wealth, and so does the royal palace
      with politics. Peace prevails in all corners of the <i>Ram Rajya</i> with everyone satiated, except for
      one. She, who is a <i>Maha Rani</i>, is in seclusion. She is restless, watching all her calculated ploys
      falling apart. Confined to her own quarters, she lacks all powers to influence the royal throne she
      used to enjoy. Instead, she reflects on her life—her decisions and choices as she authors her
      memoir. This is her Diary—a Diary of the warrior princess of Kaikeya—the daughter of
      Ashwapati, playing a pivotal role in the journey of <i>Maryada Purushottam</i>, Sri Rama.<br/><br/>

      <b>Mohalla, English Translation of a Sahitya Akademi Award-winning Rajasthani Novel, Gavvad</b><br/><br/>
      Mohalla is an English translation of Madhu Acharya Ashawadi’s Sahitya Akademi’s award-
      winning Rajasthani novel <i>Gavaad</i> (a mohalla or neighbourhood). In this novel, which has been
      hailed as the first postmodern novel written in Rajasthani literature, <i>Gavaad</i> emerges as the
      central character, where it actually represents a country. People in the <i>Gavaad</i> live together as
      people of different religions live in a country. The novel investigates various facets of the human
      psyche and touches the deeper chords of human emotions. It explores human pain with profound
      sensitivity and depicts the co-existence of good and evil in human beings. It throws a spotlight
      on the need to eliminate evil and bring out the good before society. It is also a scathing attack on
      corruption in politics. Written in absurd style, the novel appears to be without a cohesive
      structure, but in fact, it gains its structural unity from the <i>Gavaad</i> itself. The book has received
      great critical acclaim from Rajasthani critics and has been bestowed with the Sahitya Akademi
      Award for Rajasthani in 2015.<br/><br/>
